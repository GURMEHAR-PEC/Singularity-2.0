          <h1>Unleashing the Power of Community</h1>
          <p> Contribute.Collaborate.Coact This platform brings to you a chance to make full use of the PEC community
            and to be a part of the same . While you use the resources arranged by your seniors , don't forget to
            make valuable contributions for your up-coming juniors as well . Be it resources , questions ,
            information , advice , any contribution helps in strengthening the structure of this platform and in the
            same way promotes the idea behind it's working . One primary reason to bring-up this platform was the
            lack of any such platform in PEC and also the problem of scattered resources and the problems faced by
            individual students as a whole</p>

            <h1> ....The Upcoming....</h1>
            <p> No website is perfect , and no platform is complete in itself . There are always better altrenatives and
                modifications , and we at Singularity believe in the same . In order to make the platform more
                interactive , we soon plan to introduce discussions - an open platform where like minded people can
                discuss on various topics from the college . Also , we plan to introduce a separate portal for
                contributors in order to make the platform more efficient and resourceful . By using certain ML models , we also plane to enhance searchibilty in order to make the platform more accessible to all. </p>
